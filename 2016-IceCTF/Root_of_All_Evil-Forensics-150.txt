After we unzip the evil_6095a38034303df8bf2763e8f9494b3bde0fa851e0aa41a486c888b6b9f01d3b.zip, we found 'bin/evilcat' binary. It contains a string with base64 riff file with DMTF tones, to decode it we have these options:

1) Convert the file via audacity to wav and upload here: http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html
2) Using the method from http://sexyplatypussies.com/writeups/InternetwacheCTF2016/crypto80.txt we can convert DMTF tones manually to characters (Audacity -> Spectrogram, Analyse -> Plot Spectrum)

We obtain the number (GPS coordinates):
64 12673822 *21 92146998

64.12673822, -21.92146998
